# Resource-Aware Collaborative Monte Carlo Localization with Distribution Compression

## Abstract
 Global localization is essential in enabling robot autonomy, and collaborative localization is key for multi-robot systems. 
 In this paper, we address the task of collaborative global localization under computational and communication constraints. We propose a method which reduces the amount of information exchanged and the computational cost. We also analyze, implement and open-source seminal approaches, which we believe to be a valuable contribution to the community.  
  We exploit techniques for distribution compression in near-linear time, with error guarantees. 
  We evaluate our approach and the implemented baselines on multiple challenging scenarios, simulated and real-world. Our approach can run online on an onboard computer. We release an open-source C++/ROS2 implementation of our approach, as well as the baselines
## Results
We conducted a thorough evaluation of the different ap-
proaches to cooperative localization. We present our exper-
iments to show the capabilities of our method. The results
support the claims that our proposed approach (i) improves
collaborative localization, (ii) decreases the required band-
width, (iii) reduces the computational load, (iv) runs online
on an onboard computer.

## Installation
We provide Docker installations for ROS 2 Humble.
